🌐 WaveSight: Cultural Compass Concept

📊 What It Is
A 2D or 3D interactive quadrant chart that places cultural trends, creators, or topics on a cultural spectrum. Instead of left vs. right or authoritarian vs. libertarian, you define cultural axes like Tradition vs. Disruption or Niche vs. Mainstream.

🧭 Suggested Axes
Option A (2D - Easy to Visualize)

Mainstream ↔ Underground
How widely known or accepted is the trend?
E.g. Beyoncé = Mainstream / Hyperpop = Underground
Traditional ↔ Disruptive
Does it reinforce existing cultural norms or challenge them?
E.g. NASCAR = Traditional / Drag Ball Culture = Disruptive
Option B (Alternative 2D Axes)

Mass Appeal ↔ Subcultural Depth
Sentimental ↔ Ironic / Detached
Helps place Gen Z irony, meme culture, etc.
Optional 3rd Dimension (Z-Axis or Color Gradient)

Positive vs. Negative Public Sentiment
Rate of Change (Virality / Velocity Score)
Cultural Momentum (sustainability over time)
🔍 What You'd Plot
Each data point could be:

A trend (e.g. “Girl Dinner”, “Quiet Luxury”)
A creator or influencer
A meme or phrase (e.g. “based”, “rizz”)
A movement or aesthetic (e.g. “cottagecore”, “grunge revival”)
You can visualize movement over time (e.g. a trend moving from niche to mainstream, or from subversive to sanitized).

🛠 Data Sources
To determine placement, use:

Mentions and popularity → YouTube/TikTok/Reddit APIs
Audience overlap → followers/interactions between accounts
Sentiment analysis → comments scraped and scored
Virality score → from WaveScore
Semantic tags (e.g. subculture, politics, generation)

🔒 WaveSight Moat
This chart becomes a signature visualization of the app—something others can't easily replicate without your data ingestion engine, cultural labeling, and predictive scoring.

If you’d like, I can mock up quadrant samples or build out how you'd technically generate this from your Supabase data + scraped API inputs. Want to go into that?
